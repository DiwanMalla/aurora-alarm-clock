# Daily Copilot Memory Log

## Session Memory: 2025-06-21
**Changes Made**: 
- Major UI/UX overhaul: Removed quick add functionality and swipe gestures
- Implemented 3-dot options menu for AlarmCard (Edit, Skip Next, Delete)
- Created Timer screen with presets and manual time adjustment
- Created Stopwatch screen with lap tracking and best/worst lap indicators
- Added Timer and Stopwatch tabs to navigation structure
- Updated clock screen quick actions to navigate to new screens

**User Feedback**: 
- Remove quick add from all screens âœ…
- Replace swipe left/right with 3-dot menu in alarms âœ…  
- Create timer and stopwatch pages âœ…
- Hide headers for timer/stopwatch (full-screen) âœ…
- Provide sample audio for timer ðŸš§

**Technical Notes**: 
- Timer/Stopwatch have setInterval/clearInterval issues that need fixing
- User prefers touch-friendly UI without swipe gestures
- Modern iOS/Android-style interface with card layouts
- TypeScript strict typing throughout
- Uses Expo Router for navigation

**Next Session**: 
- Fix setInterval/clearInterval issues in Timer/Stopwatch
- Implement proper audio system for timers
- Test and debug current implementations
- Performance optimization

**Code State**: 
- app/alarm-creation.tsx (full-screen alarm creation, heavily enhanced)
- app/(tabs)/timer.tsx (created, needs interval fixes)
- app/(tabs)/stopwatch.tsx (created, needs optimization)
- components/ui/AlarmCard.tsx (enhanced with 3-dot menu, removed gestures)
- app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx (updated with new tabs)
- app/_layout.tsx (hidden headers for timer/stopwatch)

**Known Issues**:
- setInterval/clearInterval not defined in React Native context
- Some TypeScript linting issues in timer/stopwatch
- Need expo-av integration for actual audio playback
