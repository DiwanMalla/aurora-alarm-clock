- [ ] Test edge cases (invalid times, etc.)

### 4. Performance & Stability Testing

#### 4.1 Memory & Performance

- [ ] Monitor memory usage during extended use
- [ ] Test for memory leaks (create/delete many alarms)
- [ ] Verify smooth performance with 20+ alarms
- [ ] Test app performance in low memory conditions
- [ ] Confirm battery usage is reasonable

#### 4.2 Background Behavior

- [ ] Test alarm triggering when app is backgrounded
- [ ] Verify notifications work correctly
- [ ] Test app state restoration after backgrounding
- [ ] Confirm audio continues correctly in background
- [ ] Test with device in do-not-disturb mode

### 5. Edge Cases & Stress Testing

#### 5.1 Rapid Operations

- [ ] Rapidly create and delete multiple alarms
- [ ] Quick navigation between all screens
- [ ] Rapid audio preview start/stop cycles
- [ ] Multiple timer/stopwatch operations in quick succession
- [ ] Fast theme switching

#### 5.2 Unusual Scenarios
