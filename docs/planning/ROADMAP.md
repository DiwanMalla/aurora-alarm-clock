# Aurora Clock - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

Building a next-generation alarm clock app in phases, focusing on core functionality first and gradually adding smart features.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Features (Weeks 1-6)

**STATUS: Week 5 COMPLETED ✅ - 83% of Phase 1 Complete**

**📊 Progress Summary:**

- Week 1: Project Setup & Architecture ✅ COMPLETED
- Week 2: Basic UI & Navigation ✅ COMPLETED
- Week 3: Core Alarm Functionality ✅ COMPLETED
- Week 4: Audio & Notifications + Timer/Stopwatch ✅ COMPLETED + UI FIXES
- Week 5: Audio System Stability & Reliability ✅ COMPLETED + CRITICAL BUG FIXES
- Week 6: Testing & Polish ✅ **SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED** - 85%

**🎯 Current Status:** All core functionality implemented with polished UI + MAJOR ALARM UX IMPROVEMENTS + **CRITICAL AUDIO SYSTEM FIXES**. Timer/Stopwatch fully functional with proper spacing and scrolling. Audio system and notifications working with correct sound selection and **100% reliable audio stopping**. Alarm creation now has current time default, editable labels, working volume controls, built-in ringtones, and dropdown menus. **FIXED: Alarm preview system with unified audio stopping architecture - no more infinite loops or lingering audio. Both preview and ringing screens now use coordinated stopping logic.** Ready for final testing and polish phase.
